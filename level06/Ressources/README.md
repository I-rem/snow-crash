# level06
We are greeted with 2 files

Classic, we will try to use the file permissions to our advantage. Let's test level06 and see what happens.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cce5522-b0d1-45d8-8b54-dfed3e628d6b)

It expects a file as input.

And seemingly it just displays the contents of the file? We can learn more from the source code `$ cat level06.php`:

```
#!/usr/bin/php
<?php
function y($m) {
  $m = preg_replace("/\./", " x ", $m); $m = preg_replace("/@/", " y", $m); return $m;
}
function x($y, $z) {
  $a = file_get_contents($y); $a = preg_replace("/(\[x (.*)\])/e", "y(\"\\2\")", $a); $a = preg_replace("/\[/", "(", $a); $a = 
preg_replace("/\]/", ")", $a); return $a;
}
$r = x($argv[1], $argv[2]); print $r;
?>
```
Behold: [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_syntax.asp). 

The **preg_replace()** function returns a string or array of strings where all matches of a pattern or list of patterns found in the input are replaced with substrings. `preg_replace(patterns, replacements, input, limit, count)`

**file_get_contents** â€” Reads entire file into a string

So this script has 2 functions. The first function `y` takes an argument `m`, makes some changes on m and then returns it. The second function `x` takes two arguments `y`and `z`. y is a file whose content is read and assigned to the variable `a`. It then calls pre_replace on a and once again returns the modified string. What happened to `z` you might ask. The answer is I don't know. 

x is called with the first and second parameters provided to the script as its arguments. Then the result is printed out. I tried to run the script with different values to see if I could manipulate the output without taking a closer look at the regex but failed. I guess we actually have to understand what all these patterns are for.

[regex101](https://regex101.com/) is an amazing all-in-one tool for anything related to regex. It even has a handy substitution function which is perfect for the task at hand.

- `$m = preg_replace("/\./", " x ", $m);` This takes the string m and replaces every instance of `.`with ` x `, `a.bc` -> `a x bc`
- `$m = preg_replace("/@/", " y", $m);` This takes the string m and replaces every instance of `@` with ` y`, `a@bc` -> `a ybc`  
- `$a = preg_replace("/\[/", "(", $a);` This takes the string a and replaces every instance of `[` with ` (`, `a[bc` -> `a(bc`
- `$a = preg_replace("/\]/", ")", $a);` This takes the string a and replaces every instance of `]` with `)`, `a]bc` -> `a)bc`
-  `$a = preg_replace("/(\[x (.*)\])/e", "y(\"\\2\")", $a);`: This uses the now deprecated `e` modifier. [See](https://www.php.net/manual/en/reference.pcre.pattern.modifiers.php).

What does it do?

_If this modifier is set, preg_replace() does normal substitution of backreferences in the replacement string, **evaluates it as PHP code**, and uses the result for replacing the search string._ [See](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/remove_preg_replace_eval_modifier)

So anything formatted like [x*] will be replaced. And the replacement part will call the function y with everything in between x and ]. The replacement string weill be executed as a PHP code.

This is a huge vulnerability!

Only the square brackets should be replaced with an input like '[test@gmail.com]' as it will not trigger the function y. Let's test it out:

`level06@SnowCrash:~$ echo "[test@gmail.com]" > /tmp/test`
`level06@SnowCrash:~$ ./level06 /tmp/test`

But if we find the right format we can observe different behaviour

That's fun and all but what we really want to do is run some code.

The part of the code that will be executed is the part between x and ]. 
So perhaps something like `[x getflag]` would work?

Okay this is better than nothing. So since it will be interpreted as php code we should work on our syntax.
