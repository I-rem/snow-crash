# snow-crash
This project is an introduction to computer security. Snow Crash will make you discover security in various sub-domains, with a developer-oriented approach. You will become familiar with several languages (ASM/perl/php‚Ä¶), develop a certain logic to understand unknown programs, and become aware of problems linked to simple programming errors

# General Instructions
- To make this project, you will have to use a VM(64 bits). Once you have started
your machine with the ISO provided with this subject, if your configuration is right,
you will get a simple prompt with an IP:

  üí° If the IP address is not visible, you can get it with the comamnd `ifconfig` once you're connected

- Then you will be able to register using the following login:password:level100:level100
  Use the SSH connection available on port 4242: `$>ssh level100@192.168.16.128 -p 4242`

- Once registered, you‚Äôre gonna have to find the password that will log you in with
the "flagXX" account(XX = current level number).

üí° Once logged to the "flagXX" account, launch the `getflag` command.
  It will give you the password to connect to the next level (You may
  not be able to connect to a "flagXX" account - in this case, you will
  have to find an alternative method, like a command injection on the
  program depending on its rights, for instance!).

- Here is a session example:

- To help you with some levels, you‚Äôre gonna have to use external softwares. You
should learn to use the SCP command.

 üí° /tmp/ and /var/tmp/ folders have limited rights and will be reset
from time to time. You should not work directly on the machine.

- Nothing is left to chance. If there is a problem, start wondering if your code is not
the cause.

# Mandatory Part
- Your repo must include anything that helped you solve each validated test
- Your repository will look like this:

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af5a1c13-99f6-4a80-bb55-67a2355a8fe8)
  
- You will keep everything you need to prove your results during the evaluation in
the resource folder. The flag file may be empty, but you may have to explain why

‚ö†Ô∏è You must be able to clearly and precisely explain anything
that is included in the folder. The folder mustn‚Äôt include ANY
binary.

- If you need to use a specific file that‚Äôs included on the project‚Äôs ISO, you must download it during the evaluation. You must put it in your repo under no circumstances.
- If you plan to use a specific external software, you must set up a specific environment (VM, docker, Vagrant).
- You‚Äôre invited to create scripts that will make you stall, but you will have to explain
them during the evaluation.
- For the mandatory part, you must complete the following list of levels:
  - [level00](level00/Ressources/README.md)
  - [level01](level01/Ressources/README.md)
  - [level02](level02/Ressources/README.md)
  - [level03](level03/Ressources/README.md)
  - [level04](level04/Ressources/README.md)
  - [level05](level05/Ressources/README.md)
  - [level06](level06/Ressources/README.md)
  - [level07](level07/Ressources/README.md)
  - [level08](level08/Ressources/README.md)
  - [level09](level09/Ressources/README.md)
  
‚ö†Ô∏è You cannot bruteforce the ssh flags.

# Bonus Part
For the bonus part, you can complete the following list of levels:
- level10
- level11
- level12
- level13
- level14
