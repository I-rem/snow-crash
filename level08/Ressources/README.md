# level08
We have not one but two files this time.

When we execute level07 it asks for a file to read. But when we provide it a file (token) in this case, tells us that we don't have access. How rude!

If I don't have access then let's see who does,

That's a bummer I am not flag08. And you bet I tried to change the file permissions(that was of course a futile effort). We don't even have the read permissions for token so the contents of this file is a mystery to us.
